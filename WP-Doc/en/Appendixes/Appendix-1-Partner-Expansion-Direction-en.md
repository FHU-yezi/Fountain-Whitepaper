# Appendix 1: Partner Expansion Direction

## wallet
The healthy development of the Fountain ecosystem is inseparable from the excellent wallet application. We will consider incubating or investing in wallet applications, and we will also consider entering into market cooperation with existing wallet applications to ensure a good user experience.
## Exchange
Based on Fountainâ€™s possible massive user base in the future, we will consider incubating or investing in OTC trading applications, token-token trading applications, and actively seeking legally compliant fiat-token exchanges.
## Decentralized paid content platform
The disadvantage of the traditional centralized paid content platform is that there is no doubt that the platform obtains a large amount of revenue. The original author deserves a higher return.
## Decentralized IP investment platform
The traditional IP investment platform, which has a large amount of information is not transparent, and the IP investment platform that uses the blockchain ledger is extremely disruptive for IP investment. The wider masses will be more confident to participate.
## Community economy
Community-based activities have a strong vitality, and community leaders have taken advantage of IM's group chat features such as Telegram and WeChat to unite members and lead them to conduct diverse business activities. The content creation and consumption of members is an essential part of collaborative work. It can work through the Fountain Eco, improve collaboration efficiency, record member contributions, and distribute revenue.
## Social media
Social collaboration like Wikipedia is exciting. A token-based social media is a new experiment that is more feasible and reflects the value of social work.

The above applications are just a few examples. In fact, all parties in the content industry chain are likely to become our partners, such as photography, music, film and television, games, animation, publishing houses and so on.
